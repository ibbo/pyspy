pySpy - An I Spy game written in Python using Pygame
by Thomas Ibbotson

Release Notes:
-pyspy_1.0:
* To run the game use 'python main.py', the folder must be called
'pyspy' or it will not run as it won't be able to find the pyspy
module.
* Levels are stored at the sourceforge site http://pyspygame.sourceforge.net,
to download updates either use the menu item or run "python main.py -u".
You cannot as yet cancel the download once it has started from the gui.
To cancel from the command-line use <Ctrl-C>.
* This game has not been readily tested on Windows, there may be issues.
* If you encounter any issues please submit a bug on the launchpad site:
http://launchpad.net/pyspy.
* If you like the game, let me know. It's my first game so any feedback,
positive or negative (and constructive), is welcome. You can leave messages
on the project page on the pygame.org website.
