instructions = """pySpy is a clone of a Quiz Machine game we have 
in our college bar, except this version is free!

You can't win any money in this version, 
but then again I never did on the real thing.

Objective - Find the object in the image that 
the clue describes.

Rules - The timer counts down and you have until 
it runs out to find the object.

*The timer resets for every level. 

*Every time you click and miss some more time is 
taken away, but you do get an extra letter. 

*The first letter is always in the 
right place, but subsequent letters may not be. 

*You have several bonuses to help you if you get
stuck. The number is limited so use them wisely.

   - Reveal: This reveals the clue, all you have
     to do now is find the object.
   - Unshuffle: This puts all the currently
     visible letters into their correct positions
     in the clue.
   - Add letters: Shows some more letters in the
     clue.
